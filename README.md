# 3d-model

This repository contains the gribot 3D models for the complete robot family.

For the moment, the models are designed and built with Solidworks 2018, because open source CAD software is still a little bit limited. However, as soon as possible, we will migrate all 3D gribot models to an Open Source platform.

## Folder and file organization

There are some rules to help organizing folders of the 3D modem

* Each assembly has to have its own directory, containing all its own elements.
* A folder name should start with a capital letter
* A file name, part, assembly, should start with a capital letter


## Comments

Github is probably not the best platform to store CAD files. However, it has the merit of allowing a simple sharing.
Platforms such as [grabcad](https://grabcad.com/) might be better places to store CAD models. Unfortunately, Solidworks 2018 is not yet supported on it.
